# üîÅ LeetCode-383 Ransom Note

## Problem Statement
Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

---

## Input
- `ransomNote` (String): The note we need to construct.
- `magazine` (String): The string from which letters can be used.

## Output
- Boolean (`true` or `false`): Whether the ransom note can be constructed.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input**:  
`ransomNote = "a"`, `magazine = "b"`  
**Output**:  
`false`  
**Explanation**:  
The letter "a" is not present in "b".

---


### Example 2:
**Input**:  
`ransomNote = "aa"`, `magazine = "aab"`  
**Output**:  
`true`  
**Explanation**:  
Two "a"s are available in magazine.

## Approach

1. If the ransomNote is longer than magazine, return false immediately (optimization).
2. Create an integer array `freq` of size 26 to represent frequency of each lowercase character in magazine.
3. Loop through each character in magazine and increment the corresponding frequency.
4. Loop through each character in ransomNote:
    - Decrement the frequency.
    - If frequency goes below 0, return false as it means that letter is overused.
5. If the loop completes without returning false, return true.

‚úÖ Learn to map characters to array indices using `'c' - 'a'`  
‚úÖ Prefer arrays over maps for fixed character sets (like lowercase alphabets)  
‚úÖ Always optimize with early returns if possible  
‚úÖ Know how to handle frequency-related string questions efficiently
